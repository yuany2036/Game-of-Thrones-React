## About The Project

<img src="README/GoT.gif" width="80%"  alt="Game of Thrones API" />

Since Game of Thrones was one of my favorite shows of all time (unfortunately it was cancelled after only 4 seasons, such a shame...), I wanted to create a simple web page putting what I have learned about React and using APIs to use. And also I wanted to experiment building my own image gallery, and so there is also a gallery page where you can browse through some of the photos from the show, with a modal popping up whenever you click on a picture.
